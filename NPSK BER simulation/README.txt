In this project, we are interested in creating the graphical representation 
of Bit Error Rate(BER) of a Phase Shift Keying scheme with N number of
symbols (NPSK) as the standard deviation of Additive White Gaussian
Noise (AWGN) of the channel rises. The N-PSK scheme is parameterised
on the symbol amplitude, and on the number of symbols in the constelation,
which are placed on a circle with radius equal to the amplitude of the 
transmitted symbols (which denotes their phase shift). Each symbol is 
equally spaced with its previous symbol and the next one on the circle.

The code was written in Matlab R2014a. 

To run the code, run main.m in your Matlab copy.
